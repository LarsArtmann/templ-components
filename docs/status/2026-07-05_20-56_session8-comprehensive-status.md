## a) FULLY DONE ✅

### Bug Fixes (Real bugs, not cosmetic)

1. **ModalSize2XL/DrawerSize2XL value mismatch** — Constants named "2XL" had value `"full"` instead of `"2xl"`. Name/value/intent three-way mismatch. Lookup maps were keyed by deprecated alias, not canonical constant. **FIXED**: value changed to `"2xl"`, lookup maps rekeyed. (commit `a4215e7` → cherry-picked to master as `5ecf04f`)

2. **ErrorPageProps 404→400 status code bug** — `NotFound()` used `FamilyRejection→400` instead of 404. `Forbidden()` → 400 instead of 403. `InternalError()` → 503 instead of 500. **FIXED**: Added `StatusCode int` field to `ErrorPageProps`. All 6 constructors now set correct HTTP status codes. `ErrorHandler` checks `props.StatusCode` before falling back to `FamilyStatusCode`. Backward compatible (0 = derive from Family). (commit `a4215e7`)

3. **SRI silent fallback security issue** — `htmxMainSRI(unknownVersion)` silently returned the default version's SRI hash. The browser would block the script on hash mismatch. **FIXED**: Returns empty string for unknown versions. Per SRI spec, `integrity=""` means "no metadata" — script loads without SRI check, which is safer than a wrong hash that blocks execution. (commit `4d9a271`)

4. **LoadMore hardcoded ID** — Used `id="tc-load-more"` instead of `utils.EnsureID()`. Multiple LoadMore buttons on one page would collide. **FIXED**: Uses `utils.EnsureID("load-more", props.ID)`. Golden test updated with explicit ID for deterministic output. (commit `a294fe4`)

5. **Missing WayOutHref** — `BadRequest()`, `Conflict()`, `ServiceUnavailable()` constructors had `WayOut: "Go back"` but no `WayOutHref: "/"` — the buttons had nowhere to go. **FIXED**. (commit `4369ff2`)

### Code Quality Improvements

6. **formatInt → strconv.Itoa** — Eliminated 15-line hand-rolled int-to-string in `relative_time.templ` and `count_badge.templ`. Replaced with stdlib `strconv.Itoa`. (commit `de72e7f`)

7. **Script helper consolidation** — 4 near-identical `*ScriptComponent` functions in `display/shared.go` (overlay, tooltip, copyButton, imageFallback) extracted to single `scriptComponent(nonce, js, errLabel)`. (commit `4369ff2`)

8. **CDN helper extraction** — Duplicated CDN-defaulting logic in `layout/sri.go` (`htmxScriptURL` and `responseTargetsURL` both had the same `if cdnBase == ""` + `strings.TrimRight` pattern) extracted to `resolveCDNBase()`. (commit `4369ff2`)

9. **maxW2XL named constant** — Drawer size lookup used inline `"max-w-2xl"` literal while all other sizes had named constants. Added `maxW2XL` for naming convention consistency. (commit `4369ff2`)

10. **allIconNames() sort fix** — Spinner was appended AFTER sort, breaking alphabetical order. Now appended before sort. (commit `4369ff2`)

11. **Package doc comments** — 8 non-doc.go files had competing `// Package display/forms/etc` comments. Go convention: only `doc.go` owns the package comment. All changed to file-level comments. (commit `4369ff2`)

12. **Stale comments fixed** — Count comments in `component_props_test.go` (display 18→23, nav 6→7). Stale comment in `fromerror.go` claiming to avoid a second `errors.AsType` call that was actually performed. (commit `4369ff2`)

13. **forms/helpers.go split** — Junk-drawer file mixing ARIA, IDs, and CSS classes. Split into `ids.go`, `aria.go`, `input_classes.go`. (commit `25e2b5b`)

### Type Safety Improvements

14. **FeedbackTypeIsValid()** — Added to `feedback/styles.go` following the existing `FamilyIsValid` pattern. Lets consumers validate FeedbackType values before passing to Alert/Toast. (commit `4d9a271`)

15. **ButtonTypeIsValid(), ModalSizeIsValid(), DrawerSizeIsValid(), DrawerSideIsValid()** — Added to display package. Follows FamilyIsValid/FeedbackTypeIsValid pattern. (commit `de72e7f`)

16. **Error code constants typed** — `CodePageNotFound` etc. converted from bare `string` to `type Code string`. `ErrorPageProps.Code`, `ErrorDetailProps.Code`, `ErrorAlertProps.Code` fields now use `Code` type. `CauseItem.Code` stays `string` (holds codes from arbitrary external errors). (commit `de72e7f`)

### New Components

17. **NotFound404** — Dedicated 404 page with gradient numeral hero, optional search form, quick-links grid, go-home/go-back buttons. Full test suite (a11y, BDD, coverage, edge, example, golden). (commit `07abaf8`)

### Documentation

18. **4 HTML review reports** at `docs/reviews/`:
    - `2026-07-05_18-00_code-quality-scan.html` — Build/lint/duplication/coverage dashboard
    - `2026-07-05_18-10_data-model-review.html` — Type system audit with problem catalog
    - `2026-07-05_18-10_naming-review.html` — Identifier audit
    - `2026-07-05_18-10_full-code-review.html` — Comprehensive audit with fixes

19. **FEATURES.md freshness** — Version 0.4.0→0.6.1, component counts updated, totals fixed, ModalSize enum updated with 2XL/DrawerSide/DrawerSize.

20. **TODO_LIST.md** — Session 7 section added with all findings, 5 of 7 remaining issues marked fixed.

21. **CHANGELOG.md** — Session 7 internal entry added to `[Unreleased]`.

---

## b) PARTIALLY DONE 🟡

1. **Validation asymmetry** — `FeedbackTypeIsValid`, `ButtonTypeIsValid`, `ModalSizeIsValid`, `DrawerSizeIsValid`, `DrawerSideIsValid` added. But `AvatarSize`, `AvatarShape`, `BadgeType`, `BadgeSize`, `CardPadding`, `GridCols`, `TooltipPosition`, `SpinnerSize`, `SkeletonVariant`, `ProgressBarSize`, `StepOrientation`, `DropdownPosition`, `TabsVariant` still lack `IsValid()`. Pattern is established; remaining are mechanical copy-paste.

> ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED** — All 30 closed-set typed enums now have `IsValid()` methods + tests. 14 missing methods added in session 10. The validation asymmetry is eliminated.

2. **formatRelativeTime boundary tests** — Added but one test case fails: 59 seconds returns "just now" not "59 seconds ago". The test expectation was wrong — need to check the actual boundary threshold in the code. **Display package test suite is currently RED** because of this one failing subtest.

> ✅ **FIXED** — Test expectation corrected to expect "just now" for sub-minute values. All 13/13 packages green.

3. **OverlayKind typed enum** — Identified in shared.go:39-40 (`closeKind string` + `componentName string` encode same domain). Requires editing `.templ` source files + `templ generate`. Not started — deferred due to risk of branch-switching instability during templ regeneration.

> ✅ **DONE** — `OverlayKind` typed enum shipped (`OverlayModal`, `OverlayDrawer`). `componentName()` method derives JS function names from the kind.

4. **Integration tests for new components** — CopyButton+Card, CountBadge+Button, DefinitionGrid+Grid, Image+fallback compositions identified as untested. Not yet written.

> ✅ **DONE** — 7 composition integration tests added.

---

## c) NOT STARTED ⚪

1. ✅ **OverlayKind typed enum** — Done.
2. ✅ **CopyButton `document.execCommand('copy')` fallback** — Done.
3. ✅ **CopyButton `aria-live` for "Copied!" announcement** — Done (`role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"`).
4. ✅ **Image `srcset` limitation documentation** — Done (documented in godoc).
5. ✅ **Golden tests for StatCard HTMX + Card.Body slot** — Done.
6. ✅ **Benchmark tests for new components** — Done (display, feedback, navigation).
7. ⬜ **Validate() error method on props structs** — Deferred to v1.0.
8. ⬜ **Move test helpers to internal/testutil/** — Deferred to v1.0.
9. ✅ **Self-host htmx as default** — ADR 0007 written, deferred to v1.0 by design.

---

## d) TOTALLY FUCKED UP 💥

1. ✅ **Display package test suite is RED** — `TestFormatRelativeTimeBoundaries/59_seconds_ago` fails. **FIXED**: test expectation corrected to expect "just now" for sub-minute values. All 13/13 packages now green.

2. ✅ **Branch-switching instability** — BuildFlow kept switching to `modularize/strategic-split`. **RESOLVED**: modularize branch abandoned. No more branch-switching issues.

3. ✅ **`forms/helpers.go` LSP diagnostic ghost** — **RESOLVED**: file was deleted, split into `ids.go`, `aria.go`, `input_classes.go`. LSP diagnostics cleared.

---

## e) WHAT WE SHOULD IMPROVE 🔄

### Process

1. **Fix the branch-switching instability** — Investigate what switches branches mid-session. Check BuildFlow config, templ watcher, git hooks. This wasted 2+ hours of re-work.

2. **Push after every commit** — Multiple commits were lost to branch switching because they weren't pushed. The rule "git push when done" should be "git push after EVERY commit."

3. **Verify test expectations against actual code behavior before committing** — The formatRelativeTime boundary test was written with assumed thresholds without reading the actual threshold logic first.

4. **Run full test suite before committing** — The broken test was committed because only the specific test was run, not the full package suite.

### Architecture

5. **Consolidate IsValid() pattern** — 5 enums now have IsValid(), ~13 more need it. Consider a code generation approach or a generic `utils.IsValid[T ~string](m map[T]struct{}, v T) bool` helper.

6. **Type all remaining enums** — `Code` was the latest. Pattern is proven. Remaining bare-string constants should be typed.

7. **OverlayKind enum** — The `closeKind`/`componentName` string pair in `display/shared.go` is the last major untyped discriminator. It requires templ source editing, which makes it harder, but it's not optional for type safety.

## g) Top #1 Question I Cannot Figure Out

> ✅ **RESOLVED.** The branch-switching was caused by BuildFlow operating on whatever branch
> was checked out, combined with the modularization branch work. This was fully resolved when
> the modularization branch was abandoned. BuildFlow no longer switches branches, and the
> pre-commit hook no longer includes the problematic govalid-generate step.
