## Current Version

**v0.17.0** — pre-release. APIs may change without notice.

## Recent Highlights

### Native `<dialog>` for Modal/Drawer

Replaced ~200 lines of custom focus-trap JS with browser-native `showModal()`/`close()`. Native focus trap, Escape-to-close, focus restore, top-layer rendering.

### Stylable Select

`SelectProps.Stylable: true` opts into the modern customizable `<select>` API. Progressive enhancement — non-supporting browsers render native select.

### Auto-Growing Textarea

`TextareaProps.AutoGrow` (default `true`) uses CSS `field-sizing: content`. No JavaScript needed.

### View Transitions

`htmx.ViewTransitions(ViewTransitionsProps{Global: true})` enables native View Transitions for HTMX swaps.
